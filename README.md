WellRESTed
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pjdietz/wellrested.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pjdietz/wellrested)

WellRESTed is a micro-framework for creating RESTful APIs in PHP. It provides a lightweight yet powerful routing system and classes to make working with HTTP requests and responses clean and easy.

Requirements
------------

- PHP 5.3
- [PHP cURL](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) for making requests with the [`Client`](src/pjdietz/WellRESTed/Client.php) class (Optional)


Install
-------

Add an entry for "pjdietz/wellrested" to your composer.json file's `require` property. If you are not already using Composer, create a file in your project called "composer.json" with the following content:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "pjdietz/wellrested": "~2.3"
    }
}
```

Use Composer to download and install WellRESTed. Run these commands from the directory containing the **composer.json** file.

```bash
$ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ php composer.phar install
```

You can now use WellRESTed by including the `vendor/autoload.php` file generated by Composer.


Overview
--------

WellRESTed's primary goal is to facilitate mapping of URIs to classes that will provide or accept representations. To do this, create a [`Router`](src/pjdietz/WellRESTed/Router.php) instance and load it up with some routes.

```php
use pjdietz\WellRESTed\Response;
use pjdietz\WellRESTed\Router;

require_once "vendor/autoload.php";

// Create a new router.
$router = new Router();

// Populate the router with routes.
$router->add(
    ["/", "\\MyApi\\RootHandler"],
    ["/cats/", "\\MyApi\\CatHandler"],
    ["/dogs/*", "\\MyApi\\DogHandler"],
    ["/guinea-pigs/{id}", "\\MyApi\\GuineaPigHandler"],
    ["~/hamsters/([0-9]+)~", "\\MyApi\\HamsterHandler"]
);

// Output a response based on the request sent to the server.
$router->respond();
```
